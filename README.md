# PROOF OF CONCEPT ONLY - NOT FOR PRODUCTION

Here's a super barebones MVC microbackend built from scratch with just vanilla PHP. Has support for routing, GET, and POST as well! Models are currently a work in progress, but I will probably not build an ORM once I get around to adding it.

This should work with any LAMP stack... hopefully.
